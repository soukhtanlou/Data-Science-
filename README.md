# Introducing Dynomica: Simplifying Decision-Making with Machine Learning (MVP Edition)

## Introduction
The landscape of decision support systems (DSS) is undergoing a significant transformation with the advent of machine learning (ML) techniques. Traditional DSS, exemplified by software like Vensim, have long been relied upon for modeling dynamic systems based on expert knowledge and historical data. However, the limitations of these approaches have spurred the development of ML-powered tools such as Dynomica. Dynomica represents a paradigm shift in decision-making, offering tailored scenarios and optimized solutions through the utilization of advanced ML algorithms.
